Ciao, I'm Elisa, a Volcanology Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the University of Manchester.
I'm interested in CFD, multiphase flows and reduced order models. 
I mainly work on modelling volcanic eruption events like lava flows and magma conduit ascent.
I'm used to coding in Fortran 90 and C, and I'm currently learning python.
